# Asynchronous ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Course Repository

Hello fellow learners!

Welcome to the repository for our course, "Developing an Asynchronous ASP.NET Core 6 Web API." In this space, you'll find all the goodies related to the awesome journey of building scalable APIs with ASP.NET Core using the magic of asynchronous programming with `async/await` keywords.

## What's Inside?

### ðŸš€ Course Overview
We've been on a journey, building APIs with ASP.NET Core. Now, it's time to level up by making our APIs asynchronous! We'll be diving into the world of `async/await` and learning the ropes of when and where to use these keywords. Exciting, right?

### ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
- Get the scoop on the ins and outs of `async/await` in ASP.NET Core 6.
- Figure out when to sprinkle that magic async dust for optimal results.
- Test the waters and see how writing async code impacts our applications.
- Dive deep into async streaming, cancellation, and gracefully handling exceptions.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
1. **Exercises:** Hands-on coding exercises to solidify our understanding.
2. **Projects:** Cool projects showcasing the power of async programming in ASP.NET Core.
3. **Documentation:** Extra reading materials and guides because knowledge is power!

## Explore Away
- Check out the exercises for some hands-on coding fun.
- Dive into projects to see async in action.
- Read through the documentation for that extra knowledge boost.

## Prerequisites
- A bit of ASP.NET Core knowledge (you're here, so you've got this!)
- C# is your buddy (or at least a friendly acquaintance).
- A code editor of your choice (Visual Studio, VS Code, etc.).
